# The-Collective

The premise behind the website, “The Collective”, was a space for a group of artists to display and sell their work, while also being available to work collaboratively on larger projects/ productions if requested. I started by finding my first client, Zoe, and I created a layout for the site with the intention of the site being a single artist site to display their work and get commissions. As I was working on it, I wanted to be able to push the idea further, so I found David and asked if they would also want to be involved, which gave me the chance to work with audio as well as photographs. I then added another page for my personal work, but if in the future I was to continue this project, I would add artists who work in other mediums, such as video and graphic design.

The Home page clearly displays the title of the website in the center of the screen and the navigation bar and footer is consistent on every page. The navigation bar highlights the current page in light orange so the user can tell which page they are currently on. On the homepage, shop, and artists page a plugin was used to have the page fade in as each element is scrolled to. The bxslider plugin was used for the slide show of photos on both the Zoe and Jonathan page. The accordion widget was used on the about me page so information can be viewed and collapsed.

Some of the critiques I got early on where there were some inconsistencies with how photos were displayed and grouped, which I remedied by adding the bxslider.

For accessibility, I made sure most of the colors I used had adequate contrast, which is one of the reasons for choosing mostly white and black. All the images used have alternate texts added to them to help describe what the images are. On David’s page, the audio is set to only start if played. A lot of work was put into having the website be responsive to screen size differences.

Aesthetically, I kept a consistent style for every page. The colors used were black, white, light orange, and a dark gray (for the footer).
